One morning, when Gr
egor Samsa 
woke from troubled d
reams, he found hims
elf transformed in h
is bed 
into a horrible verm
in.

He lay on his armour
-like back, and if h
e lifted his 
head a little he cou
ld see his brown bel
ly, slightly domed a
nd divided by arches
 into stiff sections
.

The bedding was hard
ly able to cover it 
and seemed ready to 
slide off any moment
.

His many legs, pitif
ully thin compared w
ith 
the size of the rest
 of him, waved about
 helplessly as he lo
oked. "What's happen
ed to me? " he thoug
ht. It wasn't a drea
m. His room, a prope
r 
human room although 
a little too small, 
lay peacefully betwe
en its four familiar
 walls.
